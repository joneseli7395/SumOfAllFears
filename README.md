# Sum Of All Fears

## This is a unique stand-alone website designed to collect six user inputs and display a custom solution

This site is compiled of two HTML pages that each serve their own purpose. Upon load, you will land on the index page. Here, there will be six input boxes. Labled with placeholder attributes, five of these inputs act as values of an addition equation, and the sixth, labeled "Value of K", will act as the desired sum of the first five. The "Find the K" button will call a function to determine whether or not the value of K can be found through the sum of the five inputs. 
Following the top navigation menu, the Code page will display the JavaScript code used to build the function called on the index page.
